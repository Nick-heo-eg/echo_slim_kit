# EchoSlim A+ (MCP + Minimal Judgment Loop)

This is a **slim, self-contained demo skeleton** inspired by your EchoJudgmentSystem_v10-1 layout.

It is NOT your full private codebase.
Instead, it contains:
- A minimal Playwright MCP client stub
- A Dexa-style bridge launcher (Windows PowerShell → npx @playwright/mcp)
- A Codex-style UI runner stub
- A tiny, toy "judgment loop" to show structure
- tools_registry / echo_bridge_config examples

You should replace the `TODO_REAL_IMPL` sections with the corresponding real implementations
from your full repo if you want this to behave like the production system.
